# pca9685-rpi-hat
KiCAD schematics and pcb for a raspberry pi enabling control of 16 PWM channels using a PCA9685.
I kept TH only components to ease hand soldering for newbies, but i'm planning on making an SMD version as well.

### TO-DO List

- [ ] Build an alternative pcb with SMD components.
- [ ] Assign correct R values to PWM lines resistors
- [ ] Assign a value to C2 (PWM power rail), probably 1mF.
